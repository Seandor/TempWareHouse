I think the main reason why english speakers have this concept of "oh no, if i speak a broken language, natives will hate me", is because within english itself there exists this huge stigma that if you make a mistake in english, you're the laughing stock and a retard. How many times online have you seen comments about how shitty someones english is, and mocking them for it as being worth less as a human being?  Hilariously, this is almost exclusive to English. If you learn almost any other language, even complex languages with thousands of years of intricate history like Chinese, people appreciate even just the attempt at speaking two words. Never scorning you for mispronouncing them. But if you mispronounce an english word, you're labelled as a fucking dumb motherfucker. Even if it's not your mother tongue!!  That's the problem, it lies within english culture in social media. Thats why so many english speakers have a fear of speaking another language, because they think they'll recieve the same treatment in that language, if they dont speak it perfectly.?
